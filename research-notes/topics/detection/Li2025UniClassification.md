#  the Exponential Reliability Advantage of Sequentiality in Universal Classification

This notes is inspired by the talk delivered by Prof. IH Wang in 2025 Fall at NYCU.

## Binary Hypothesis Testing

## Asymptotic Behavior of Binary HT
mostly the results from the theory of methods of types.

## Information Projection

### LLR as difference of KL divergence

### Hoeffding's test

## Sequential Detection and Performance Gain 

Sequentiality achieves optimal in both miss and false alarm performance.
- Optimal stopping -> inference
- the performance gain is given by the early stopping


## Universal Classification
Motivated by Ziv's Universal Data Compression.

Unaware of the explicit model, just empirical statistics
